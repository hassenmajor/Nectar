        Please enter an unbalanced chemical equation, and click ENTER.
        You can also enter a molecule to get the molar mass.

        \nNectar is a chemical balancer that is also used to measure molar masses of molecules.

        \n\nDespite all the care taken to ensure that the balancing of the chemical equations and the calculation of the molar masses are exact,
        we can make no guarantees and hold no responsibility for incorrect results.
